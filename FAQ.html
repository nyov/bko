    <h1>FAQ for BKO</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Question: When should I use BKO for booting?</p>
    <p>
      We envision following usage for BKO
      <ol>
        <li>
          To experiment with different distributions available on this site, and install one which you like most.
	</li>
	<li>
          To save your data/system when somehow your system is messed up and you want to recover it. You can use
	  many of the tools available on BKO to rescue yourself.
	</li>
	<li>
	  You can do automated mass booting and automated installation for large number of workstations.
	  This can be done by adding specific embedded script to BKO (or by having your private BKO server).
	</li>
	<li>
          Other than these, if you find any other use for BKO, then please share with us. we will be glad to hear from you.

  <p>Question : Why it is slow?</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Your entire Operating System is fetched over Internet from <i>far far away server</i> and this takes time.
      </li>
      <li>
	The delay is mostly in booting process, once the system is booted, it should work faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recommend you to choose closeby mirror, which will give you <strong>much</strong> better performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        In most of the usage scinario's mentioned above, some delay is tolarable.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recommend you to not to run your daily system from BKO, Please install one of the system available on BKO.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Question : What about my privacy and security?</p>
  <p>
    We understand your concern, following clarifications should make matter clear for you. You are free to make any decision after that.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your machine will only download data from server and will never send to the server. So you need not worry about privacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        We provide unmodified ISO's of all distributions, You are always welcome to verify the checksum with actual distribution provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even better, you can provide the path of the ISO directly, and your machine will use only that ISO.
      </li>
      <li>
        We only modify InitRAMFS, which is needed to boot over HTTPFS. This modified InitRAMFS is deleated once booting is complete.
	Hence, if you trust the ISO used, you can trust the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is Open Source project, you are welcome to review the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        We also plan to support HTTPS for avoiding any data-tempering on the way.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Question : Why should I create BKO enabled USB? </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating BKO enabled USB is one-time job, once it is created, you need not worry about upgradation, as it is taken care by BKO servers.
	It will always let you boot with latest distributions and tools available on BKO.
      </li>
      <li>
        You do not waste your USB as there is way to create BKO enabled USB which can be used as normal data storage device.
	As BKO takes less than 1 MB of space, you have almost entire USB for data storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        BKO enabled USB can be used to boot (almost) any system as long as there is Internet connectivity.<br/>
	It is worth considaring this ability against 1MB of space and few minutes for cretion of BKO enabled USB.
