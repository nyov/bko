<p>Our objective is to let users boot their machines with bare minimal requirements on their side,
and we will handle most of the problem that you may face in booting. All that user needs is Internet
connectivity and a small program (gpxe) to boot the machine. This gpxe program provides network booting facility.
You can download these program from our site (available at download section).

various rescue tools which can help in data recovary and in other situations. The list of existing choices is available here, 
and we assure you that this list will grow over time :-)
